# Basic lipid parsing

Lipids are made of defined building blocks. This building blocks are represented in shorthand notations.
These shorthands notations can be parsed to get the individual build blocks

```{r setup}
library(lipidomicsUtils)

lipid <- "PC(16:0/18:1(9Z)"

get_lipid_category(lipid)
get_lipid_class(lipid)
get_lipid_subclass(lipid)
```
